## Usage
`"Item" - all classes, crew types, upgrades, items, abilities, upgrades, etc.`

- All bars can be adjusted by clicking on the box that you want to check. Clicking or right-clicking a checked box will uncheck it.
- To add items you can click a corresponding link or drag items from compendium/game to the sheet.
- All "class/crew" specific items are prefixed with first letters
- To enable Deep Cuts options, use the settings menu.

- I don't want the "class/crew items" to be prepopulated, so the character sheet contains less "compendium" info.
- To see the description of Class, Vice, Background, etc you can just click added item and see all the info in the popup.
- When adding a new item you can hower a "question-circle" icon to see the item's description.
- To add Custom abilities just add a new "Foundry Item" of the corresponding type and fill all the necessary info. Then drag it to the sheet or add via button on a sheet.

Classes:
- (F)  Face
- (H)  Hacker
- (M)  Muscle
- (P) Punk
- (R) Rigger

Crew Types:
